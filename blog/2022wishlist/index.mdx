I started my plant journey in 2020, with maybe 1 succulent and some miscellaneous cuttings. 
In 2021, this hobby has really gotten just a little insane, as I entered 2022 with some 60 plants. 
While it was fun, I do think that it is time for me to redirect my energy from collecting
many plants, to growing well the plants I already have. I would like to enjoy more aspects of 
this hobby rather than collecting all the plants. 

2022 Plant Goals:
1. Spend less money on plants! Ideally, I would like to spend net 0 money on plants this year, and simply
do more trades. Easier said than done because I am already out a bit from paying for equagenera imports, 
but I will do my best!
2. Make more local plant friends to trade with! 
3. Flower an orchid, and an anthurium. It is a far out wish to someday be an orchid or anthurium
hybridizer, but when better to start preparing than now? 
4. Grow my anthurium seedlings into established plants
5. Grow more genus's of plants!

And now onto the fun part!

Plants I am looking to trade for in 2022!
These are grouped by genus.

**Anthurium Forgetii**
I *love* anthurium, if I could only grow one species of plants I just might choose anthuriums. 
Unfortunately most of these suckers cost a pretty penny, so I only chose a few for my 
wishlist this year. One that I am prioritizing is the anthurium forgetii, not just for its 
unique little twist of having a closed sinus, but also because it pups easily and is a 
much more shareable anthurium than most of my favourites. As one of my priorities this year
is to trade more and make more plant friends this will definitely be handy, which is why
I am prioritizing the forgetii this year.

**Anthurium Waroqueanum Dark Form**
My skill with anthuriums is getting better. I am able to keep an anthurium regale alive,
(alive but not very good looking) so I would like to try my hand at a notably more difficult
anthurium that almost every anthurium collector probably likes. It is none other than
the queen anthurium. I ordered a beautiful dark form in from equagenera, hopefully it likes 
me! This is one I'm very excited to receive and document, even if it ends up being a stump!

**Begonia (any beginner begonia)**
Another one of my goals this year is to experiment with plants outside of the popular aroids.
For this reason, I'd like to attempt a cane begonia. With the spots they look so fun! There 
are many cane varieties available, however I'd assume one of the more common ones is begonia 
maculata as it is apart of Costa's trending tropicals. Nevertheless, if possible at some 
point I'd like a begonia snow ice if possible. The white dots and the frosted look makes it
look like a plant out of frozen!

**Hoya Krohniana Splash**
Splashy hoyas seem to be very popular and I would like to try some out aswell. It seems
to me a good beginner splashy hoya is the hoya krohniana which has recently come down
in price a little bit. I also really love the teardrop shaped leaves. I did receive a node 
of this in a trade, but I might've killed it. I'm not very good with hoyas it seems, but
I would definitely like to try again!

**Hoya Heushkeliana varigata**
If there ever was a fun, colourful small leaf hoya hands down it'd definitely be the
hoya heushkeliana varigata! I don't know too much about this plant but I really love
how a full pot of this looks. And I hear they bloom quite easily as well so I'm really
excited for that! In my personal opinion, I think this is the prettiest varigated 
hoya I've ever seen. A full pot might cost an arm and a leg but I also hear 
they grow at a not terrible speed for hoyas.

**Hoya multiflora (or other flowering hoya)**
I really want to try to bloom a hoya this year! Unfortunately most of the hoyas I 
currently have are not known to be prolific at blooming in household conditions so I 
have to change that up a bit. Unfortunately, I haven't seen these for sale much but
I'd love a hoya multiflora! I hear lacunosa also flowers often (and has a sweet scent 
too!) but I think the multiflora's blooms are so much more unique!

**Maranta silver band**
One of my favourite prayer plants is the maranta kerchoviana (rabbits foot maranta?) 
and ever since then I've wanted more. Even as my maranta at home is getting a little 
ragged and crispy (probably due to winter) the leaves are still so beautifu. I'm 
not particularly partial to the maranta with the veins (though I wouldn't mind), but
I've wanted the maranta silver band ever since I first saw it in a kaylee ellen youtube 
video. I don't know where I could possibly find one of these, however I still really want 
one.

**Philodendron Sodiroi**
The sodiroi has a stunning amount of silver on it for a philodendron. My desire for a sodiroi
is somewhat quenched, due to me getting the philodendron majestic just over a week ago, 
but I still think a large philodendron majestic is one of the most stunning plants out 
there and I would like one eventually!

**Philodendron golden dragon**
Maybe its because of this plant's cool name, but I think a philodendron golden dragon is 
super exotic looking with it's unique shape. I would absolutely love one with good stable 
varigation, however that costs an arm and a leg to get so I will be fine with a green 
or mottled one for now. I think, this is absolutely the plant I want for a big statement
philodendron.

**Philodendorn burle marx varigata**
Again, this year I'm prioritizing some wishlist plants that are much more shareable, and 
I've heard very good things about philodendron burle marx varigata from literally any 
burle marx owner. This plant would also be a super good source of alba varigation (yellow)
for not a whole lot of money. I would put this plant in the same category as the previously
mentioned hoya heushkeliana varigata, as in ideal bushy varigated plant. I don't think this 
plant gets super large either, so a great space saver!

**Pingulata (or any beginner carnivorous plant)**
The pingulata, or mexican butterwort is what I've heard to be a fun way to deal with the 
endless supply of fungus gnats that is a side effect of an ever growing plant collection. 
Some of these even (I think) seem to sunstress to pink which is super fun! However, I'm not 
that set on a pingulata, honestly any beginner carnivorous plant is probably okay. Their 
adaptions are super cool, even though they seem to be slightly finnickier plants. I'd still
really love one, even if they weren't a great natural pesticide.

**Ripsalis baccifera (or paradoxa & other epiphytic cacti)**
Ever since I got my first epiphytic cacti last year, I've really wanted more. I've heard 
good things about the ripsalis genus and I think I'd really like to trade for a baccifera 
or a paradoxa! Unfortunately every time I see ripsalis in plant stores they seem to be 
unideal looking and I tend to pass them up to put my money towards another plant, but lets
make it a priority to trade for one this year!

This plant wishlist is super long and I'm so tired of typing all of it up, but it is probably 
like 1/3rd of my actual wishlist. I know its a priority of mine this year to focus on quality
of plant over quantity, but I never said it wouldn't be a struggle! Nevertheless these plants 
are my priority for this year and I can't wait to see what I end up getting
