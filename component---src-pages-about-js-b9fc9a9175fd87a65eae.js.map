As someone who spends a lot of\r\n          of time outside, I was really slowly being driven insane thanks to the quarantines. So \r\n          I dedicated my frenzied energy into figuring out how to bring the outside, well, inside!\r\n          I'm going to attempt to write regular blog posts about the state of my plants, new plant \r\n          projects, updates on projects, things I'm trying out, and just whatever prickles my fancy.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>I am excited to share all of my musing with everyone else in the plant community and \r\n          hopefully together we can grow bigger and happier plants!\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>This project was built using Gatsby and Github Pages. I would like to thank everyone\r\n          who helped me with this project and put up with me as I struggled.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>If you're interested in whats going on behind the scenes in my development learning\r\n          process and my plant learning process, feel free to check out my trello board that I'm \r\n          using for organization. I am trying to alternate development and content creation\r\n          weeks. Expect new articles every other week. Heads up!
